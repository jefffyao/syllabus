<a name="coursedes"> COURSE DESCRIPTION </a>

The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. You will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts.
The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. You will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. You will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading.
Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. You also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.
This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that you work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about your own work and the work of your peers in supportive and respectful ways.  A laptop and relevant software are required.
It is my hope that this class will help you become better typographers and develop deeper awareness and appreciation for type. Type is everywhere; you might as well make it your friend.

  <a name="projects">PROJECTS</a>
Weeks 1-10  Weekly Letterform
<div>Draw a letter every week based on Instructor’s description of it. You may use any medium as long as the final submission is a PNG file (1080 × 1080 px) with transparent background and it demonstrates understanding of the letterform as described by Instructor. You will upload their submission to the course Google Drive before class every week.</div>
<div>Weeks 1-2  Typeface Deep Dive
Familiarize yourself with contemporary typefaces and learn how to talk about and evaluate them. Choose a typeface by a living designer and present it to the class. You will use Keynote to put together your presentation.</div>
<div>Weeks 3-5  Poster Series
Design a series of three event posters. Select an event—past, upcoming, or imaginary—that you want to advertise. Poster is a great medium to explore two different sides of typography: expressive and informational. This is a typographic poster, meaning it will not contain pictures. You may, however, use simple shapes and/or type as image.
Think about which information is necessary on all posters. Use only one typeface unless there is a compelling reason to introduce another. It is important to print at 100% scale every time.</div>
<div>Weeks 5-9  Reverse
As a designer, you’re usually given content for which you’re expected to make design decisions, including the typeface choice. For this project, we’re reversing the order of business:
Choose a typeface first, then come up with appropriate content for which the typeface may work well. You will get to know your typeface on a deep level before designing anything at all. Instead of asking the usual question “does the typeface have the required character set or the right voice for the content?” ask: “what are the strengths and the personality of this typeface and what does it want to be used for? In what environments can this typeface shine?” </div>
<div>Weeks 9-13  Book
In this module, we will build on the tradition of book design by learning all the elements that form a thorough reading experience: finer points of type, visual systems, pagination systems, binding, and reading itself. Collect 2–3 essays, articles, short stories, or other writings and organize them into chapters. Your texts may be about a topic/theme, by the same author, or loosely related in some other way. Your design must demonstrate an investigation of grids, typeface choices, and typographic hierarchy.
For the web page, choose one essay/article from your book and re-create it for the web. Consider point size, font weight, line length or measure, leading, letter spacing, styling/emphasis.</div>
